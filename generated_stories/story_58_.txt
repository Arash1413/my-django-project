text of story:

"Working is good or bad?" Maya mused, staring at the overflowing sink full of dirty dishes.  The question, posed by her seven-year-old son, Leo, echoed in the small kitchen.  It wasn't a simple yes or no, she knew.  For years, she'd juggled multiple part-time jobs, the kind that paid the bills but left her bone-tired and emotionally depleted.  "Working is…complicated, Leo," she finally said, picking up a soapy sponge.

"Complicated?" Leo tilted his head, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Maya sighed, remembering the early mornings, the rushed lunches eaten standing up, the constant feeling of being behind.  "Sometimes, working is good," she began, "because it means we have a roof over our heads, and food on the table, and new crayons for you."  She pointed to the box of brightly colored crayons sitting on the counter.  Leo's face lit up.

"But," she continued, carefully scrubbing at a stubborn crust of burnt cheese, "sometimes working is bad.  It means I don't have enough time to play with you, or read you stories before bed, or just…be with you."  She paused, looking at her son’s earnest face.  "It means I get tired, and sometimes I'm grumpy, and that's not fair to you."

Leo considered this, his small fingers tracing the edge of the crayon box. "So, it depends?"

"Exactly," Maya said, smiling warmly.  "It depends on what kind of work it is, how much work it is, and how it makes you feel.  A good job should make you feel happy and fulfilled, even if it's hard sometimes.  It shouldn't take away from the things that are really important, like family and friends, and having fun."

She rinsed the sponge and looked around the cluttered kitchen.  "Maybe," she added thoughtfully, "maybe working isn't just about the money.  Maybe it's about finding something you love to do, something that makes you feel good about yourself, something that gives you time for the things that really matter."  She scooped Leo up in a hug.  "And spending time with you, my sweet boy, that's the best part of all."  The dishes could wait.  For now, they had each other. The complicated question of work could be pondered later, over a game of building blocks and a shared, well-deserved bedtime story.
